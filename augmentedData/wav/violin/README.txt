PLEASE CHECK README FOR MORE INFO ON HOW TO GENEARTE YOUR OWN DATA

Wow, you opened me, I was not expecting you to come this far!
Here have a sit and a cup of tea.

Unfortunatly, due to github's file size limitations, I will not be able to include all the necessary input and augmented data in here for you to use straight away.
You can however generate this part of the dataset, you can first run the file "midToWav.py", which will generate all the wav files from the midi files. (YOU MUST RUN "csvToMidi" BEFORE YOU RUN CAN RUN THAT SCRIPT) Then, if you want precussion augmented into the files too, you can run "precussionAug.py" to generate them after you generated all your wav files.

Note that all included augmenting and encoding scripts are a WIP, meaning that if something breaks or does not work, you can post the problem to this github's issues page so I can see it and fix it.

Good luck and happy coding ;)
