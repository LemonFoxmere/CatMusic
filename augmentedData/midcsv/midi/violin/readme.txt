Wow, you opened me, I was not expecting you to come this far!
Here have a sit and a cup of tea.

Unfortunatly, due to github's file size limitations, I will not be able to include all the necessary input and augmented data in here for you to use straight away.
You can however generate this part of the dataset, you can run the file "csvToMidi.py"

Note that all included augmenting and encoding scripts are a WIP, meaning that if something breaks or does not work, you can post the problem to this github's issues page so I can see it and fix it.

Good luck and happy coding ;)
