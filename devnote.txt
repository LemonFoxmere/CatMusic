1. sound frequency cannot be determined from 1 sample
  a. you must have multiple samples put in at once to get a frequency. This means that the data that does into the LSTM cannot have shape (1,), but it must be something like (1,10) so it has some room to work with
2. the raw audio data must be splitted up into multiple smaller sections to avoid overfitting and long training durations.
3. the data is limited, so we must augment it by either manipulating its speed, pitch, or amplitudes
4. amplitudes in the raw audio file does not affect the resulting frequency as much as the resulting output is independent that of the amplitude
5. there's gonna be alot of bitch works
6. data processing transcribe to CPP code

TODO:
1. aquire sample data and see if model works
2. find out how to write out midi files
3. find full data sections

PLAN:


File type into LSTM:
Format:
1| TEMPO={tempo}
2| TRACK_START
3| {time_start}.{time_end}.{[freq1, freq2]/silence}
4| ...
5| {time_start}.{time_end}.{[freq1, freq2]/silence}
6| TRACK_END

output encoding: ONE_HOT (128 slots)

Time event calculation:
Absolute time is based on 1/16th of a MIDI clock. Calculation are as follow:
1_clock_period = ((tempo/1,000,000)/24)/16
absolute_time{seconds} = clock_period * clock_repetition
